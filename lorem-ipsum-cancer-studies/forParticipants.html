            <h2>Information for Participants</h2><hr>
            First, thank you for your interest in our study!  We are grateful for everyone 
              who would like to help us.
            <br>
            <h3>What is the study about?</h3>
            This study is to learn why some people get cancer and other people
                 don't.  We are looking at causes from the environment and from our genes.
            <br> 
            <h3>Why was I invited?</h3>
            <p class="bold">If we invited you to our study, we are NOT saying you have
              cancer.</p>
            We need all different kinds of people for our research: not only people with cancer, but also people without cancer.
            <br>
            <h3>Why should I participate?</h3>
            For you, this is a chance to help medical scientists learn how to better 
            prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer.  This will help people heal faster and get less 
              sick in the future.  Also, we will pay you $50 for your time.
            <br>
            <h3>What would I be asked to do?</h3>
            We ask you to meet us for only one visit which lasts about one hour.  This visit involves:
              <ol>
                <li>Taking a short survey about your medical history;</li>
                <li>Drawing a small amount of blood;</li>
                <li>Collecting a urine sample.</li>
              </ol>
            <h3>Is the research study safe?</h3>
            We take our responsiblity to keep you safe very seriously.
            <br>
            An ethics committee (the Human Research Protections Office, or HRPO) read our study plan and
            decided the risk to participants is minimal, and that there are only three risks to be aware of:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><i>Risk of getting a bruise.</i>  There is risk of a bruise with any blood draw.  
                We use only a small butterfly needle.</li>
              <li><i>Risk of feeling uncomfortable with personal questions.</i>  We let you skip any 
                questions in the questionnaire that make you feel uncomfortable.  </li>
              <li><i>Risk of breach of privacy.</i>  We live in the 21st century, and unfortunately 
                there are hackers out in the world.  However, hacks are unlikely because 
                the university takes many safeguards to keep your information safe.  Also, your 
              information is seen only by scientists who need to see it, and would only be used for 
            this one research project.</li>
            </ol>
            You will be given a copy of the consent form before you do anything with us.  It has
            all these details and more about being a participant our study, so you can decide if 
            it is right for you.
            <br>
            <h3>Still have questions?</h3>
            If have any questions or concerns about the study, you should first reach out to 
            our study lead, <a href="mailto:xyz@uli.edu" target="_blank">Dr. Ipsum</a>.  If 
            you have further concerns, you may reach out to 
            <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html" style="display:inline" target="_blank">the HRPO.</a></p>
